# INTRO
This project is to write an Html+Javascript program to find a path from the mouth of this cave to one of the innermost cave rooms. Each cave has room-to-room directed links (edges) that obey three rules principles. You begin at the cave mouth which has coordinates (16,0,0). You are attempting to find a route to the "most-central" cave room of he great Asgwilanga Caverns.
